**All homework is due by the day and time listed on the course site.**

For this homework, you will save the `R Markdown` (e.g., `.Rmd`) homework document and save it to your `/report` directory for your `dataviz-exercises` project. Either rename or save a copy of this file so that its name has the prefix `2024_lastname_firstinitial`. Full name example: `2024_cookg_hw_01.Rmd`. For this homework, you can submit one file for the team. Just list all team members who have contributed. 

*Enter your name(s) in the author YAML code above*   

<!--
NOTE: I will create homework assignments with the intention to facilitate progress toward the final project. Homework assignments, like other class activities, will involve working with data to address bite-sized sub-goals of the project. Although readings will work with external data sets, homework assignments will generally focus on your project data unless there is a call to do so. If teams are not meeting weekly, logging goals and accomplishments, and working together, I will adjust homework assignments to work with different data. These homework are already available and easy to deploy.

# **Overview**

You will save this `R Markdown` file, edit it by referencing this  [page](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/authoring_basics.html) to assist with some `R Markdown` items, and knit (create) an html version of the assignment to upload to a link at the bottom of this file.

# **Team Unity: Meetings**

Most of you have communicated in the class survey that you believe you often contribute to projects more than do other team members. On one hand, this suggests that many of you are committed to doing good work and as a team should be able to accomplish goals easily. On the other hand, egocentric biases in availability and attribution [(Ross & Sicoly, 1979)](http://web.mit.edu/curhan/www/docs/Articles/biases/37_J_Personality_Social_Psychology_322_%28Ross%29.pdf) often occur because strong, durable, and well-learned memories associated with our own experiences are retrieved more quickly and easily than weaker memories associated with what others have told us. As a result, we often perceive personal contributions to be greater than other even when they are equal simply as a function of retrieval bias.

Although we cannot eliminate such retrieval biases, *clear* and *consistent* communication among team members will circumvent many related issues. Communicating weekly goals and accomplishments *clearly* will a) eliminate ambiguity about personal goals because you are intentional about your commitments, b) eliminate ambiguity about what others' goals, c) allow for equitable distribution of tasks, and d) highlight completion of or failure to complete goals. *Consistent* communication does much of the same but also a) builds team cohesion and unity, b) ensures personal accountability and c) allows for timely intervention when team members are contributing inequitably.   

Determine time and location of a weekly in-person team meeting and enter below, even if for 30 minutes to discuss weekly accomplishments and goals for the next week. 

Provide the **time and location** at the prompts below but use `R Markdown` code to make them italicized.

Time:

Location:



# **Project Proposal: Identifying Questions**

Having reviewed the project proposal, provide a general summary of the goals and identify 2-3 questions that you would like to ask the liaison during the first meeting. Enter them as `R Markdown` bullet points.  




# **Specifying Team Roles**

Review the project team roles and determine who might be best suited for certain types of tasks. Provide the names corresponding to roles below and edit the roles to make bold in `R Markdown`. Understand that everyone will participate in all tasks but some members will handle more specific details, which reduces confusion. 

Project Manager:

Writing Lead:

Coding Lead: 

Coding Lead/Support: 


Once done with the above, please knit your `R Markdown` file as an `html` file.

A subsequent homework will involve you working in a Git branch, staging a file, committing it, pushing it to the remote repo, and performing a pull request. If you did not do this from an earlier exercise, I recommend practicing.



Finally, knit an `html` file containing that image file and upload to:
