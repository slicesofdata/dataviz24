    "text": "Course Description\nData visualization is the science and art of creating graphical representations of information and data. Visual representations provide accessible ways to see patterns, trends, and outliers in data. Variables like position, size, and orientation can focus attention and guide perception but can also bias interpretation of data. Students will learn how well-designed visualizations can reduce bias and improve comprehension for data thereby facilitating data-driven decision-making. Students will explore techniques for creating effective visualizations based on principles from cognitive and perceptual psychology, art, and design. Students will gain hands-on experience coding real-world data visualizations for local offices, organizations, and industry participants.\nThe course is targeted toward students with expressed interest in cognition and cognitive biases related to data communication, students interested in using visualization to communicate their own messages, and students interested in creating better visualization tools and systems. Students will engage in discussions of the readings, complete programming and data analysis assignments, and prepare a final project involving storytelling with data visualizations.\nPrerequisite: For data-science sequence or majors (level-A data-science course); recommended a course in Perception, Visual Attention, Cognitive Psychology, or Cognitive Science; or permission of instructor\n\nCourse Specific Learning Goals\n\nUnderstand various uses of visual variables to create data visualizations;\nUnderstand both advantages and disadvantages of using visual variables to create data visualizations;\nAnalyze, critique, and revise data visualizations;\nUnderstand the functionality of the ggplot2 library for creating data visualizations;\nPresent data with visual representations for your target audience, task, and data;\nIdentify appropriate data visualization techniques given particular requirements imposed by the data and/or audience; and\nApply appropriate design principles in the creation of presentations and visualizations\n\nThe following departmental learning goals will also be met: 1. Knowledge of major concepts in cognitive psychology; 2. Understanding of research methods in psychology, including research design, data analysis and interpretation; 3. Development of critical-thinking skills and use of the scientific approach to solve problems related to behavior and mental processes; 4. Oral and written communication skills."

    "text": "Overview\nStudents will read materials covering data-set relevant cognitive functions or abilities and tasks or tools used to measure those abilities. They will also will learn about coding in R, data validation and wrangling, and support their current knowledge of statistical probability and inference.\nCoding for Data Science: Students will be introduced to functional programming using R, application of models, and use of popular data-science libraries, (e.g., dplyr, ggplot, stringr, etc.). Students would learn elements of programming (e.g., assignment, functions, function arguments, operators, objects, passing objects, control flow, etc.).\nData Validation and Wrangling: Students will learn how to wrangle raw data, clean, and manipulate data. The course would involve both data wrangling and data cleaning. Students would learn main concepts of data sanitation of messy data, for example, how to clean, recode, de-dup, fix structural errors and typos, standardize data, etc. in service of applying machine-learning models.\nProject Management: Projects for academics and industry involve collaboration as well as organization of code and materials. Students will learn about and maintain a project with an organized directory structure both locally and remotely with collaborators using Git and GitHub.\nAcademic Integrity. Although you may find yourself working on assignments with a partner or discussing them with classmates, all assignments should be your one original work. You are not to share materials with other students if that material has the potential of being copied, even if your intention is not to allow a classmate to copy your work. Any signs of academic dishonesty will be submitted to the Academic Standards Committee for review. Although I do not anticipate any events of academic dishonesty, any form of dishonestly of any form will not be tolerated.\nMany students are unclear of the definition of plagiarism and for that reason I have posted some CMC links to information that I believe will clarify the issue. In addition, any work completed for another course, past or present, may not be submitted for a grade for this course. http://registrar.academic.claremontmckenna.edu/acpolicy/default.asp\nCourse Modules. This course will be split into modules, allocating various weeks depending on the scope of the module."

    "text": "College Policy on Academic Integrity\nThe faculty and administration of Claremont McKenna College support an environment free from cheating and plagiarism. Each student is responsible for being aware of what constitutes cheating and plagiarism and for avoiding both.\n\nViolations of Academic integrity\nEach student is responsible for understanding and acting in accordance with the College’s policy on Academic Integrity, described below.\n\n\nAcademic Integrity\nAlthough you may find yourself working on assignments with a partner or discussing them with classmates, all assignments should be your one original work. You are not to share materials with other students if that material has the potential of being copied, even if your intention is not to allow a classmate to copy your work. Any signs of academic dishonesty, even those raised by concerned peers, will be submitted to the Academic Standards Committee for review. Although I do not anticipate any events of academic dishonesty, any form of dishonestly of any form will not be tolerated. Many students are unclear of the definition of plagiarism so I have posted some CMC links to information that I believe will clarify the issue. In addition, any work completed for another course, past or present, may not be submitted for a grade for this course and would be a violation of integrity. http://registrar.academic.claremontmckenna.edu/acpolicy/default.asp\n\nStatement of Reasonable Accommodations\nI have an eye disease and visual impairment and understand the need for accommodations. Your experience in this class is important to me. If you have already established accommodations with Disability & Accessibility Services at CMC, please communicate your approved accommodations to me during the first week of the semester so we can discuss your needs in this course ASAP. You can start this conversation by forwarding me your accommodation letter. If you have not yet established accommodations through Accessibility Services but have a temporary health condition or permanent disability (conditions include but are not limited to: mental health, attention-related, learning, vision, hearing, physical or health), you are encouraged to contact Assistant Dean for Disability Services & Academic Success, Kari Rood, at AccessibilityServices@cmc.edu to ask questions and/or begin the process. General information and accommodations request information be found at the CMC DOS Accessibility Service’s website. Please note that arrangements must be made with advance notice in order to access the reasonable accommodations. You are able to request accommodations from CMC Accessibility Services at any point in the semester. Be mindful that this process may take some time to complete and accommodations are not retroactive. I would err on the side of caution and make sure your accommodations are sent to me even if you do not believe you need them as some students only learn they may need time after completing assessment. The Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act do not make accommodations retroactive. If you are approved for extra testing time for example, you must do so before an electronic assessment is posted in order for it to be integrated into the assessment. Claremont McKenna College values creating inclusive and accessible learning environments consistent with federal and state law. If you are not a CMC student, please connect with the Disability & Accessibility Services Coordinator on your campus regarding a similar process.\n\n\n\nFYI on cheating etc.\nRemember, you are responsible for not cheating or violating CMC’s Academic Integrity Policy. You are responsible for understanding that policy, and for conducting yourself in a manner such that you do not violate the policy.\nThe above link lists many examples of cheating and plagiarism that are not allowed. There are many more specific acts that you should NOT do. Here is an additional list of activities that will be sufficient cause for immediate failure in the course.\n\nDo not take pictures of exam or quiz questions and share them with other students\nDo not give other students answers during an exam or quiz, or any other assignment that is an individual assignment\nDo not copy work from another source and submit it as your own\nDo not copy and paste text from the internet and submit it as your own words\nDo not copy and paste text and slightly alter wording to pass the work off as your own\nDo not hire someone else to do the coursework for you\nDo not copy and paste text into a paraphrasing app, and then submit the output of the paraphrasing app as your own work\nDo not copy random words from the internet that have nothing to do with the assignment and submit them as your own work.\nDo not work on individual assignments with other students, share answers or other material, and then all hand in versions of the same thing that are slightly different.\nDo not plagiarize yourself by submitting work that you have previously completed in another class.\n\n\n\nMandate to report violations\nIf a faculty member suspects a violation of academic integrity and, upon investigation, confirms that violation, or if the student admits the violation, the faculty member MUST report the violation. Students should be aware that faculty may use plagiarism detection software.\nThere is no excuse for cheating. Students who are caught cheating may receive a failing grade for the entire course. All students found to have violated the academic integrity will be sanctioned by the Academic Standards Committee."

During weekly team meetings, team members can discuss accomplishments and progress, and check off tasks. Provided many of you have never taken on such tasks and thought about how to break tasks into smaller bite-sized pieces, a general framework maybe be helpful for you.\n\n\nLarge-Scale Tasks\nSome tasks have to be performed in a sequential order but others can be integrated throughout other tasks. For example, describing the motivation of the project, explaining the data and variables used, describing how you prepared the data, presenting findings, etc. are all part of the Report Drafting process. Components can be, and should be, worked on in piecemeal so that they are all not delayed until the end.\n\nReview the project proposal details in /docs\nReview any project documents in /docs to understand the structure of the data and identify relevant variables\nSchedule to meet with liaison to discuss project in order to formulate a game plan; ask about variables of interest\nOutline the project plan and develop a timeline (consider how timeline maps onto course topics)\nRead data, clean and prepare data for summaries, visualizations, and models\nMerge data parts from team members\nIntegrate team member sub-goal code files\nFinalize report\n\nReport drafting. This tasks can get integrated within the other tasks. For example, delegating tasks, setting deadlines for rough drafts, etc.). Relevant references in /refs can be disseminated, read, and used to prepare the theoretical and conceptual motivation for the project.\n\n\nSmaller-Scale Tasks: A Suggested Process for working with Cognitive Tasks/Survey Questions\nTeams will be working with the symmetry span task, the go/no-go task, and other demographic and response variables. Some variables (viz., tasks or survey) will need to be parceled out and transformed (pivoted) in order to work with in a manageable way. Other response variables may contain only a single question and may require recoding (e.g., response options to numbers) but would not require transformation in the form of pivoting. When there are multiple response options (data columns) as there are with the cognitive tasks, a recommendation is the break the task into pieces.\nA recommended sub-goal process is described below\nA. Break full data into task/survey data\n\nImport master data file\nSelect variables of interest for that Task/Survey\nWrite out wide &lt;task&gt;_wide.rds data file containing ids and variables for that task\nEnsure all files are lowercase with no spaces; use - or _\n\nB. Clean the task/survey data\n\nTransform Data: Pivot wide to long\nWrite out long &lt;task&gt;_long.rds data file\nClean, create, etc. relevant variables (not aggregated)\n\nC. Aggregate/Summarize task/survey data\n\nWrite out long task_long_clean.rds data file\nAggregate/Summarize Data: Create participant level relevant data (e.g., average accuracy, average response time, etc.)\nWrite out long &lt;task&gt;_long_agg.rds data file\n\nD. Prepare aggregated task/survey data for statistical description\n\nIf doing correlation with other variables, sometimes need to transform the data frame. If so:\nPivot long to wide\nWrite out long &lt;task&gt;_wide_agg.rds data file\n\nE. Produce Data Summaries: Descriptive Statistics\nF. Generate any relevant visualizations * using either data that are aggregated or are not aggregated\nG. Modeling: Test relevant prediction(s)"

But what happens if we don’t pass variables to select?\n\nselect(.data = USArrests)\n\ndata frame with 0 columns and 50 rows\n\n\nYou will see the that the returned data frame has 0 columns and 50 rows.\n\nPiping using |&gt;\n\nIf you pipe the data frame into the function, .data = USArrests is inherited and you do not need to declare it within select().\n\nUSArrests |&gt;\n  select()\n\ndata frame with 0 columns and 50 rows\n\n\nAgain, the returned data frame has 0 columns and 50 rows. If you use select() without specifying any variables for the function to select, as seen in both examples, you will have data frame that contains no columns. Let’s address some methods for selecting variables.\n\nSelecting Variables by Column Position\nVariables are columns in a data frame, so they can be selected by their element position (previously covered here). If you wanted to select the first and third column, one way is to specify each position separated by a comma.\n\nUSArrests |&gt;        # take the data frame\n  select(1, 3)      # select columns 1 and 3\n\n               Murder UrbanPop\nAlabama          13.2       58\nAlaska           10.0       48\nArizona           8.1       80\nArkansas          8.8       50\nCalifornia        9.0       91\nColorado          7.9       78\nConnecticut       3.3       77\nDelaware          5.9       72\nFlorida          15.4       80\nGeorgia          17.4       60\nHawaii            5.3       83\nIdaho             2.6       54\nIllinois         10.4       83\nIndiana           7.2       65\nIowa              2.2       57\nKansas            6.0       66\nKentucky          9.7       52\nLouisiana        15.4       66\nMaine             2.1       51\nMaryland         11.3       67\nMassachusetts     4.4       85\nMichigan         12.1       74\nMinnesota         2.7       66\nMississippi      16.1       44\nMissouri          9.0       70\nMontana           6.0       53\nNebraska          4.3       62\nNevada           12.2       81\nNew Hampshire     2.1       56\nNew Jersey        7.4       89\nNew Mexico       11.4       70\nNew York         11.1       86\nNorth Carolina   13.0       45\nNorth Dakota      0.8       44\nOhio              7.3       75\nOklahoma          6.6       68\nOregon            4.9       67\nPennsylvania      6.3       72\nRhode Island      3.4       87\nSouth Carolina   14.4       48\nSouth Dakota      3.8       45\nTennessee        13.2       59\nTexas            12.7       80\nUtah              3.2       80\nVermont           2.2       32\nVirginia          8.5       63\nWashington        4.0       73\nWest Virginia     5.7       39\nWisconsin         2.6       66\nWyoming           6.8       60\n\n\nLet’s remind ourselves of how piping works. Remember that piping will modify the data frame in steps, with each pipe passing the current form of the data frame to the next function. Not that you ever want to write two lines of code and perform this extra step to select only column 1 but you could pipe the data frame to another select().\n\nUSArrests |&gt;        # take the data frame\n  select(1, 3) |&gt;   # select columns 1 and 3\n  select(1)         # then select column 1 only\n\n               Murder\nAlabama          13.2\nAlaska           10.0\nArizona           8.1\nArkansas          8.8\nCalifornia        9.0\nColorado          7.9\nConnecticut       3.3\nDelaware          5.9\nFlorida          15.4\nGeorgia          17.4\nHawaii            5.3\nIdaho             2.6\nIllinois         10.4\nIndiana           7.2\nIowa              2.2\nKansas            6.0\nKentucky          9.7\nLouisiana        15.4\nMaine             2.1\nMaryland         11.3\nMassachusetts     4.4\nMichigan         12.1\nMinnesota         2.7\nMississippi      16.1\nMissouri          9.0\nMontana           6.0\nNebraska          4.3\nNevada           12.2\nNew Hampshire     2.1\nNew Jersey        7.4\nNew Mexico       11.4\nNew York         11.1\nNorth Carolina   13.0\nNorth Dakota      0.8\nOhio              7.3\nOklahoma          6.6\nOregon            4.9\nPennsylvania      6.3\nRhode Island      3.4\nSouth Carolina   14.4\nSouth Dakota      3.8\nTennessee        13.2\nTexas            12.7\nUtah              3.2\nVermont           2.2\nVirginia          8.5\nWashington        4.0\nWest Virginia     5.7\nWisconsin         2.6\nWyoming           6.8\n\n\nThe better approach is just to select column 1 in a single line.\n\nUSArrests |&gt;\n  select(1)\n\n               Murder\nAlabama          13.2\nAlaska           10.0\nArizona           8.1\nArkansas          8.8\nCalifornia        9.0\nColorado          7.9\nConnecticut       3.3\nDelaware          5.9\nFlorida          15.4\nGeorgia          17.4\nHawaii            5.3\nIdaho             2.6\nIllinois         10.4\nIndiana           7.2\nIowa              2.2\nKansas            6.0\nKentucky          9.7\nLouisiana        15.4\nMaine             2.1\nMaryland         11.3\nMassachusetts     4.4\nMichigan         12.1\nMinnesota         2.7\nMississippi      16.1\nMissouri          9.0\nMontana           6.0\nNebraska          4.3\nNevada           12.2\nNew Hampshire     2.1\nNew Jersey        7.4\nNew Mexico       11.4\nNew York         11.1\nNorth Carolina   13.0\nNorth Dakota      0.8\nOhio              7.3\nOklahoma          6.6\nOregon            4.9\nPennsylvania      6.3\nRhode Island      3.4\nSouth Carolina   14.4\nSouth Dakota      3.8\nTennessee        13.2\nTexas            12.7\nUtah              3.2\nVermont           2.2\nVirginia          8.5\nWashington        4.0\nWest Virginia     5.7\nWisconsin         2.6\nWyoming           6.8\n\n\n\n\nSelecting Variables by Column Name\nRather than position, you will likely wish to select by variable name. We will address several approaches for doing so. Each approach are benefical in different contexts.\n\nSelecting Variables as Unquoted Expressions\nVariables can be passed separately without quotes. We can pass two arguments, one with Murder and the other with Assault, separating each with a comma. Because of some special characteristics of the {dplyr}, we can use variable names without quotes. Let’s also reduce the returned data frame using head() in order to save space.\n\nUSArrests |&gt; \n  select(Murder, Assault) |&gt; \n  head()\n\n           Murder Assault\nAlabama      13.2     236\nAlaska       10.0     263\nArizona       8.1     294\nArkansas      8.8     190\nCalifornia    9.0     276\nColorado      7.9     204\n\n\n\n\nSelecting Variables as Characters/Strings\nYou are most likely familiar with variable names as quoted strings. We can pass two arguments here using the variable names in quotes. This approach is more similar to a procedures use with in base R functions as you cannot pass unquoted expressions in base R.\n\nUSArrests |&gt; \n  select(\"Murder\", \"Assault\") |&gt; \n  head()\n\n           Murder Assault\nAlabama      13.2     236\nAlaska       10.0     263\nArizona       8.1     294\nArkansas      8.8     190\nCalifornia    9.0     276\nColorado      7.9     204\n\n\n\n\nSelecting Variables as a Character Vector\nWhat if your variables were in a vector, c(\"Murder\", \"Assault\"))?\n\nUSArrests |&gt;\n  select(c(\"Murder\", \"Assault\")) |&gt; \n  head()\n\n           Murder Assault\nAlabama      13.2     236\nAlaska       10.0     263\nArizona       8.1     294\nArkansas      8.8     190\nCalifornia    9.0     276\nColorado      7.9     204\n\n\nThe same will work if you passed a numeric vector c(1, 3).\n\n\nSelecting Using an External Vector Object\nIn many use cases, you will will have a vector of variable names that would will want to pass rather than type individually. This approach also reduces confusion when you have key variables that you want to work with. Create a vector once and then use again and again. If you make any changes, you will only have to make them once, rather than in multiple places.\nFirst, create the vector object:\n\nkeep_vars &lt;- c(\"Murder\", \"Assault\")\n\nSecond, Then pass the vector into the function:\n\nUSArrests |&gt;\n  select(keep_vars) \n\nWarning: Using an external vector in selections was deprecated in tidyselect 1.1.0.\nℹ Please use `all_of()` or `any_of()` instead.\n  # Was:\n  data %&gt;% select(keep_vars)\n\n  # Now:\n  data %&gt;% select(all_of(keep_vars))\n\nSee &lt;https://tidyselect.r-lib.org/reference/faq-external-vector.html&gt;.\n\n\n               Murder Assault\nAlabama          13.2     236\nAlaska           10.0     263\nArizona           8.1     294\nArkansas          8.8     190\nCalifornia        9.0     276\nColorado          7.9     204\nConnecticut       3.3     110\nDelaware          5.9     238\nFlorida          15.4     335\nGeorgia          17.4     211\nHawaii            5.3      46\nIdaho             2.6     120\nIllinois         10.4     249\nIndiana           7.2     113\nIowa              2.2      56\nKansas            6.0     115\nKentucky          9.7     109\nLouisiana        15.4     249\nMaine             2.1      83\nMaryland         11.3     300\nMassachusetts     4.4     149\nMichigan         12.1     255\nMinnesota         2.7      72\nMississippi      16.1     259\nMissouri          9.0     178\nMontana           6.0     109\nNebraska          4.3     102\nNevada           12.2     252\nNew Hampshire     2.1      57\nNew Jersey        7.4     159\nNew Mexico       11.4     285\nNew York         11.1     254\nNorth Carolina   13.0     337\nNorth Dakota      0.8      45\nOhio              7.3     120\nOklahoma          6.6     151\nOregon            4.9     159\nPennsylvania      6.3     106\nRhode Island      3.4     174\nSouth Carolina   14.4     279\nSouth Dakota      3.8      86\nTennessee        13.2     188\nTexas            12.7     201\nUtah              3.2     120\nVermont           2.2      48\nVirginia          8.5     156\nWashington        4.0     145\nWest Virginia     5.7      81\nWisconsin         2.6      53\nWyoming           6.8     161\n\n\nHmm. Warning message.\nNote: select(keep_vars) is deprecated as a solution, so if you see this approach someplace, it won’t work properly at this time or in the future. The warning message states that cannot do this without some modifications. What is suggested is all_of(). When your variables are in an external variable, all_of(keep_vars) will tell select() that your variables are all of the variables in the vector. Yes, this is an extra step but worth the flexibility.\n\nUSArrests |&gt;\n  select(all_of(keep_vars)) |&gt; \n  head()\n\n           Murder Assault\nAlabama      13.2     236\nAlaska       10.0     263\nArizona       8.1     294\nArkansas      8.8     190\nCalifornia    9.0     276\nColorado      7.9     204\n\n\nBut this could be problematic if a variable in your vector does not exists. Let’s add some variables that are not in the data frame and then pass that vector.\nkeep_vars_more &lt;- c(\"Murder\", \"Assault\", \"Var_x\", \"Var_y\", \"Var_z\")\n\nUSArrests |&gt;\n  select(all_of(keep_vars_more)) |&gt; \n  head()\nYou will see the following error message:\nError in `all_of()`:\n! Can't subset columns that don't exist.\n✖ Columns `Var_x`, `Var_y`, and `Var_z` don't exist.\nTip: Rather than using all_of(), use any_of(). In this instance, any of the variables that exist in the data frame will be selection. Those variables that are not in the data frame will be ignored. With this approach, your code will not break if there something changes.\n\nUSArrests |&gt;\n  select(any_of(keep_vars_more)) |&gt; \n  head()\n\n           Murder Assault\nAlabama      13.2     236\nAlaska       10.0     263\nArizona       8.1     294\nArkansas      8.8     190\nCalifornia    9.0     276\nColorado      7.9     204\n\n\n\n\nSelecting Variables Starting with or Ending with Certain Characters\nOne thing about {dplyr}, when you load the library, there are functions from other libraries that are imported along with {dplyr}’s own functions. These important functions are designed to work with each other, so the people who maintain the libraries have packaged them up nicely so you don’t have to load separate libraries.\nMany of the functions are imported from the {tidyselect} library and these functions are what give you additional manipulation ability. Some imported functions are: all_of(), any_of(), contains(), ends_with(), everything(), last_col(), matches(), and starts_with().\nWith functions like starts_with(), contains(), and ends_with(), you can select variables containing character patterns in their names. For example, rather than code out all variables for a memory span task, you might want to grab variables that contain the characters \"span\".\nRather than hard coding variable names (e.g., \"span_time1\", \"span_time2\", c(\"Murder\", \"Assault\")) to pass as an argument to select(), you would use another function to perform the heaving lifting for you (e.g.,starts_with()). In this case, the variable names that starts_with() specific character patterns get passed to select(). This process represents a good example of whe what is referred to as functional programming. This is also a good example of working smarter, not harder. Rather than coding specifically what to pass as an argument to another function, you utilize another function to pass its returned object as an argument to another function.\n\n\nSelecting Variables Using starts_with()\n\nUnderstanding starts_with()\nBut first, we need to understand what starts_with(), actually does. The function name should provide you some insight but for more information, use ?starts_with.\nstarts_with(match, \n            ignore.case = TRUE, \n            vars = NULL\n            )\nParameters/Arguments:\n\nmatch: a character vector\nignore.case: if TRUE, the default, ignores case when matching names. This is most flexible.\nvars: a character vector of variable names. If not supplied, the variables are taken from the current selection context (as established by functions like select() or pivot_longer()).\n\nThe best way to understand the function is to use it (after reading the documentation). Let’s try out starts_with(). Let’s set a required pattern match = some character and because vars = NULL by default, let’s just set vars = some character vector. If you reviewed the documentation or looked at the arguments above, vars is not the second parameter, so you will want to name it in the function call if it takes that second position as seen below. We will first test this function without using it on a data frame.\nWe set match = \"a\" and vars = c(\"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Bye\"). This will look for character \"a\" to match the elements of a character vector c(\"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Bye\").\n\nstarts_with(match = \"a\", \n            vars = c(\"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Bye\")\n            )\n\ninteger(0)\n\n\nWhat is returned is integer(0), which is actually speak for “there is no match”. Not very intuitive. Hmm, OK. Let’s try another character.\n\nstarts_with(match = \"b\", \n            vars = c(\"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Bye\")\n            )\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nOK, so now an integer is returned (yes, try is.integer() if you don’t believe me).\n\nis.integer(\n  starts_with(\"b\", \n              vars = c(\"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Bye\")\n              ))\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nAnd even though you only see one value, this object is still a vector. We can check using is.vector().\n\nis.vector(\n  starts_with(\"b\", \n              vars = c(\"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Bye\")\n              ))\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n\nImportantly, starts_with() returns a vector of values. What do the values correspond to? The values in the vector refer to the element index/position of a match and the number of the elements in the vector tells refers to the number of matches found. Because the third string element \"Bye\" starts with \"b\", that’s what is returned.\nTry something else:\n\nstarts_with(\"h\", \n            vars = c(\"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Bye\")\n            )\n\n[1] 1 2\n\n\nNow the function returns a vector containing 1 and a 2, giving length = 2, representing both the first and the second elements start with “h”.\nImportantly, letter casing is ignored because ignore.case = TRUE by default. Set to FALSE if you want your match to be case sensitive.\n\nstarts_with(\"h\", \n            vars = c(\"Hello\", \"Hi\", \"Bye\"), \n            ignore.case = F\n            )\n\ninteger(0)\n\n\nAnd now there are no matches.\n\n\nSelecting Variables from a Data Frame using starts_with()\nYou will typically use starts_with() when working with a data frame and in conjunction with other functions, like select() in order to select variables that start with certain characters. When using starts_with() in the context of select(), the vars argument is essentially passing vars = the names of the columns of the data frame passed to select().\nExample:\nselect(mydataframe,\n       starts_with(match = \"my pattern\",\n                   vars = \"var names of mydataframe\")\n      )\nLet’s provide two use cases:\n\nWithout Piping\n\nYou can pass the data frame as the first argument to select().\n\nselect(USArrests, \n       starts_with(\"m\")\n       ) |&gt; \n  head()\n\n           Murder\nAlabama      13.2\nAlaska       10.0\nArizona       8.1\nArkansas      8.8\nCalifornia    9.0\nColorado      7.9\n\n\nNotice that the only column variable that is returned is Murder.\n\nWith Piping\n\nYou can also pipe the data frame into select(), which assumes the first argument is a data frame. This is a process you will see used often by others.\n\nUSArrests |&gt;\n  select(starts_with(\"m\")) |&gt; \n  head()\n\n           Murder\nAlabama      13.2\nAlaska       10.0\nArizona       8.1\nArkansas      8.8\nCalifornia    9.0\nColorado      7.9\n\n\n\n\nSelecting Variables using ends_with()\nYou can use ends_with() to find matches at the end of strings. This function is useful if you have variables that end based on their measurement type (e.g., “_rt” or “_acc” for reaction times and accuracy, respectively). Having the foresight to create variables is such a way to make accessing them easily later is a good example of working smarter, not harder.\n\nUSArrests |&gt;\n  select(ends_with(\"t\")) |&gt; \n  head()\n\n           Assault\nAlabama        236\nAlaska         263\nArizona        294\nArkansas       190\nCalifornia     276\nColorado       204\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting and Selecting Out Variables By/Between Index\nSo far, we have address selecting variables. There are, however, many approaches for selecting but also selecting out or omitting column variables. In other words, rather than including 14 out of 15 variables, you could simply exclude 1 of the 15 variables to achieve the same result.\nYou can pass multiple arguments for each specification or you can pass a single vector that contains all specifications.\n\nselect(1, 2): select first and second columns\nselect(c(1, 2)): select first and second columns\nselect(-c(1, 2)): select out first and second columns\nselect(1:2): select first through second columns\nselect(c(1:2)): select first through second columns\nselect(-c(1:2)): select out first through second columns\n\nPotential Recommendation: use options utilizing c() to pass a vector because this habit will be more versatile with base R functionality. However, online solutions will likely not take this approach.\nLet’s make a data frame to work with first. We will name the data frame DAT even though this is a terrible name because it lacks diagnosticity.\n\nDAT &lt;- \n  data.frame(\n    Id  = c(100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 100, 105),\n    Sex = c('male', 'female', 'Male', NA, 'man', \"male\", \"neither\"),\n    Age = c(25, 33, 27, 40, 44, 25, 40),\n    Renting = c(\"yes\", NA, \"yes\", NA, \"no\", \"yes\", \"yes\")\n)\n\nSelect columns 1 and 2:\n\nDAT |&gt;\n  select(1, 2) \n\n   Id     Sex\n1 100    male\n2 101  female\n3 102    Male\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;\n5 104     man\n6 100    male\n7 105 neither\n\n\nSelect columns 1 and 2 as a vector containing values 1 and 2:\n\nDAT |&gt;\n  select(c(1, 2)) \n\n   Id     Sex\n1 100    male\n2 101  female\n3 102    Male\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;\n5 104     man\n6 100    male\n7 105 neither\n\n\nSelect out columns 1 and 2 as a vector containing values 1 and 2:\n\nDAT |&gt;\n  select(-c(1,2)) \n\n  Age Renting\n1  25     yes\n2  33    &lt;NA&gt;\n3  27     yes\n4  40    &lt;NA&gt;\n5  44      no\n6  25     yes\n7  40     yes\n\n\nSelect from columns 1 to 2 using the : operator:\n\nDAT |&gt;\n  select(1:2) \n\n   Id     Sex\n1 100    male\n2 101  female\n3 102    Male\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;\n5 104     man\n6 100    male\n7 105 neither\n\n\nSelect from columns 1 through 3 using a vector containing the : operator:\n\nDAT |&gt;\n  select(c(1:3)) \n\n   Id     Sex Age\n1 100    male  25\n2 101  female  33\n3 102    Male  27\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;  40\n5 104     man  44\n6 100    male  25\n7 105 neither  40\n\n\nSelect out columns 1 through 3 using a vector containing the : operator:\n\nDAT |&gt;\n  select(-c(1:3))   # select out from here to there\n\n  Renting\n1     yes\n2    &lt;NA&gt;\n3     yes\n4    &lt;NA&gt;\n5      no\n6     yes\n7     yes\n\n\n\n\nSelecting and Selecting Out Variables By or Between Character Name\nThese approaches are similar to those offered earlier except that some involve passing variables by their name (e.g., character names). Whereas the order of the variables in a data frame may move around, the names may be more stable or permanent, at least after you have cleaned up the names. Consequently, passing variables by name may be more foolproof.\nYou don’t have to be familiar with all approaches and you may settle on using one that makes the most sense to you.\n\nselect(\"var1\", \"var2\")\nselect(c(\"var1\", \"var2\"))\nselect(-c(\"var1\", \"var2\"))\nselect(var1:var2))\nselect(c(\"var1\":\"var2))\nselect(-c(\"var1\":\"var2))\n\nRecommendation: use options utilizing c() as this will be more versatile with base R functionality.\nThese function approaches also work but they may lead to some confusion regarding usage of quotes:\n\nselect(var1, var2)\nselect(c(var1, var2))\nselect(-c(var1, var2))\n\nSelect variables Id though Age using the : operator:\n\nDAT |&gt;\n  select(Id:Age)                            # select from here to there\n\n   Id     Sex Age\n1 100    male  25\n2 101  female  33\n3 102    Male  27\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;  40\n5 104     man  44\n6 100    male  25\n7 105 neither  40\n\n\nSelect variables Id though Age passed as strings using the : operator:\n\nDAT |&gt;\n  select(\"Id\":\"Age\")                        # select from here to there\n\n   Id     Sex Age\n1 100    male  25\n2 101  female  33\n3 102    Male  27\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;  40\n5 104     man  44\n6 100    male  25\n7 105 neither  40\n\n\nSelect variables Id though Age as a vector containing the variable names passed as strings and using the : operator:\n\nDAT |&gt;\n  select(c(\"Id\":\"Age\"))                     # select from here to there\n\n   Id     Sex Age\n1 100    male  25\n2 101  female  33\n3 102    Male  27\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;  40\n5 104     man  44\n6 100    male  25\n7 105 neither  40\n\n\nSelect out variables Id though Age as a vector containing the variable names passed as strings and using the : operator:\n\nDAT |&gt;\n  select(-c(\"Id\":\"Age\"))                    # select out from here to there\n\n  Renting\n1     yes\n2    &lt;NA&gt;\n3     yes\n4    &lt;NA&gt;\n5      no\n6     yes\n7     yes\n\n\nYou can also use the ! operator to select NOT these variables (therefore, all others)\n\nDAT |&gt;\n  select(!c(\"Id\":\"Age\"))                    # select out from here to there\n\n  Renting\n1     yes\n2    &lt;NA&gt;\n3     yes\n4    &lt;NA&gt;\n5      no\n6     yes\n7     yes\n\n\n\n\nSelecting and Selecting Out Variables Characters in Their Names\n\nselect(starts_with(\"characters\"))\nselect(ends_with(\"characters\"))\nselect(contains('e'))\n\n\nSelecting using starts_with()\nSelect variables which start with character “i”:\n\nDAT |&gt; \n  select(starts_with('i'))\n\n   Id\n1 100\n2 101\n3 102\n4 103\n5 104\n6 100\n7 105\n\n\nSelect variables which DO NOT start with character “s”:\n\nDAT |&gt; \n  select(-starts_with('s'))\n\n   Id Age Renting\n1 100  25     yes\n2 101  33    &lt;NA&gt;\n3 102  27     yes\n4 103  40    &lt;NA&gt;\n5 104  44      no\n6 100  25     yes\n7 105  40     yes\n\n\n\n\nSelecting using ends_with()\nSelect variables which end with character “e”:\n\nDAT |&gt; \n  select(ends_with('e'))\n\n  Age\n1  25\n2  33\n3  27\n4  40\n5  44\n6  25\n7  40\n\n\nSelect variables which end with character “e”:\n\nDAT |&gt; \n  select(-ends_with('e'))\n\n   Id     Sex Renting\n1 100    male     yes\n2 101  female    &lt;NA&gt;\n3 102    Male     yes\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;    &lt;NA&gt;\n5 104     man      no\n6 100    male     yes\n7 105 neither     yes\n\n\n\n\nSelecting using contains()\nSelect variables which contain character “g”:\n\nDAT |&gt; \n  select(contains('g'))\n\n  Age Renting\n1  25     yes\n2  33    &lt;NA&gt;\n3  27     yes\n4  40    &lt;NA&gt;\n5  44      no\n6  25     yes\n7  40     yes\n\n\nSelect variables which DO NOT contain character “g”:\n\nDAT |&gt; \n  select(-contains('g'))\n\n   Id     Sex\n1 100    male\n2 101  female\n3 102    Male\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;\n5 104     man\n6 100    male\n7 105 neither\n\n\n\n\nSelecting using regular expressions\nSometimes you do not want to search for specific character strings. Instead, you might want to look for strings that contain particular character patterns. For example, typing out var1, var2, var3 could be annoying. You might prefer just grabbing variables that match the pattern \"var\".\nWe will use some regular expressions, or regex, to help us. For the regex, you we will need to specify some code for finding patterns. For example, \\\\d{4} will search for patterns with 4 digits, whereas the dot star .* will help with all patterns. In particular, . refers to any character (e.g,. digit, alpha character, or any other special character) and * means zero or more times, so this pattern will search for all files that start with 4 digits followed by anything in the name. A pattern will restrict the search to files containing that exact character string. Some example will be helpful.\n\nSelecting variables of all patterns using \".*\"\nSelect variables containing a regular expression, use matches():\n.* will grab all names because it means any character and any number of times\n\nDAT |&gt; \n  select(matches(\".*\"))\n\n   Id     Sex Age Renting\n1 100    male  25     yes\n2 101  female  33    &lt;NA&gt;\n3 102    Male  27     yes\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;  40    &lt;NA&gt;\n5 104     man  44      no\n6 100    male  25     yes\n7 105 neither  40     yes\n\n\n\n\nSelecting variables with digits using \"\\\\d\"\n\\\\d will grab all variables containing a digit:\n\nDAT |&gt; \n  mutate(var_1    = 1,\n         var_11   = 1,\n         var_3    = 1,\n         var1_var = 1\n         ) |&gt;\n  select(matches(\"\\\\d\"))\n\n  var_1 var_11 var_3 var1_var\n1     1      1     1        1\n2     1      1     1        1\n3     1      1     1        1\n4     1      1     1        1\n5     1      1     1        1\n6     1      1     1        1\n7     1      1     1        1\n\n\n\n\nSelecting variables that start and contain characters \"v.*\\\\d\"\nv.*\\\\d will grab all variables that start with v and then contain any characters which are followed by a digit:\n\nDAT |&gt;\n    mutate(var_1    = 1,\n           var_11   = 1,\n           var_3    = 1,\n           var1_var = 1\n         ) |&gt;\n  select(matches(\"v.*\\\\d\"))\n\n  var_1 var_11 var_3 var1_var\n1     1      1     1        1\n2     1      1     1        1\n3     1      1     1        1\n4     1      1     1        1\n5     1      1     1        1\n6     1      1     1        1\n7     1      1     1        1\n\n\n\n\nSelecting variables that end with a digit using \"\\\\d$\"\n\\\\d$ will grab all variables ending in a digit ($ means end):\n\nDAT |&gt; \n    mutate(var_1    = 1,\n           var_11   = 1,\n           var_3    = 1,\n           var1_var = 1\n           ) |&gt;\n  select(matches(\"\\\\d$\"))\n\n  var_1 var_11 var_3\n1     1      1     1\n2     1      1     1\n3     1      1     1\n4     1      1     1\n5     1      1     1\n6     1      1     1\n7     1      1     1\n\n\n\n\n\nSelecting variables by negation\nYou can also negate all regular expression matches if you want to exclude:\n\nDAT |&gt;\n      mutate(var_1    = 1,\n             var_11   = 1,\n             var_3    = 1,\n             var1_var = 1\n             ) |&gt;\n  select(-matches(\"\\\\d$\"))\n\n   Id     Sex Age Renting var1_var\n1 100    male  25     yes        1\n2 101  female  33    &lt;NA&gt;        1\n3 102    Male  27     yes        1\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;  40    &lt;NA&gt;        1\n5 104     man  44      no        1\n6 100    male  25     yes        1\n7 105 neither  40     yes        1\n\n\nNote: The functions will return lowercase and uppercase variable name matches because the default behavior is ignore.case = TRUE.

If the column variable Sex is in the data frame and cases are 'male', 'men', 'female', 'women', 'neither', NA, etc., you can specify the column Sex variable and then the row matching condition(s).\n\nFiltering Matches to a Specific Character Value\nThe first argument in dplyr::filter() is a data frame, and the function all dplyr::filter(DAT, Sex == 'female') will filter the data frame named DAT to include rows for which the sex column equals 'female'.

Cases containing 'Male', 'Men' (R is a case-sensitive language), or 'female', for example, will not be included in the returned data frame because they do not match values in the string vector.\n\n\nFiltering by a Relative Value\n\nUSArrests |&gt;\n  filter(Murder &gt; 10)\n\n               Murder Assault UrbanPop Rape\nAlabama          13.2     236       58 21.2\nFlorida          15.4     335       80 31.9\nGeorgia          17.4     211       60 25.8\nIllinois         10.4     249       83 24.0\nLouisiana        15.4     249       66 22.2\nMaryland         11.3     300       67 27.8\nMichigan         12.1     255       74 35.1\nMississippi      16.1     259       44 17.1\nNevada           12.2     252       81 46.0\nNew Mexico       11.4     285       70 32.1\nNew York         11.1     254       86 26.1\nNorth Carolina   13.0     337       45 16.1\nSouth Carolina   14.4     279       48 22.5\nTennessee        13.2     188       59 26.9\nTexas            12.7     201       80 25.5\n\n\nThose rows with Murder above 10 will be retained, others removed.\n\n\nFiltering by a Specific Value\n\nUSArrests |&gt;\n  filter(Murder == 12.1)\n\n         Murder Assault UrbanPop Rape\nMichigan   12.1     255       74 35.1\n\n\nThose rows with Murder == 12.1 will be retained.\nUsing a previous example with this data set, we can filter based on a character variable if we had one.

    "text": "Removing duplicate rows using distinct()\nWe will examine some other filtering methods that do not use filter() specifically but that which perform filtering operations.\n\ndplyr::distinct(): remove duplicate rows\ndplyr::distinct(., column): remove duplicate rows by specific column\nna.omit(): remove any row with NA’s (missing values)\n\nLet’s use the simple DAT data frame.\n\nDAT\n\n   Id     Sex Age Renting\n1 100    male  25     yes\n2 101  female  33    &lt;NA&gt;\n3 102    Male  27     yes\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;  40    &lt;NA&gt;\n5 104     man  44      no\n6 100    male  25     yes\n7 105 neither  40     yes\n\n\nRemember that data frames are composed of rows and columns. As discussed previously we can subset in base R to illustrate a point.\nRow row 1, all columns:\n\nDAT[1,]\n\n   Id  Sex Age Renting\n1 100 male  25     yes\n\n\nRow row 6, all columns:\n\nDAT[6,]\n\n   Id  Sex Age Renting\n6 100 male  25     yes\n\n\nNotice that rows 1 and 6 are the same person (e.g., Id) and have exactly the same data for all variables. If we compare the two logically, we will confirm that all is TRUE.\n\nDAT[1,] == DAT[6,]\n\n    Id  Sex  Age Renting\n1 TRUE TRUE TRUE    TRUE\n\n\nYou clearly do not want duplicates of data. So let’s just remove any rows that are identical using distinct()\n\nRemoving Duplicates Across All Variables\n\nDAT |&gt;\n  distinct()       # Remove exact duplicates across all columns\n\n   Id     Sex Age Renting\n1 100    male  25     yes\n2 101  female  33    &lt;NA&gt;\n3 102    Male  27     yes\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;  40    &lt;NA&gt;\n5 104     man  44      no\n6 105 neither  40     yes\n\n\nIf you know each row is unique based on a variable in the data frame, you can also use distinct() to remove duplicates for a specific variable. Make sure that this variable specification is actually one that you would not want duplicates of.\n\n\nRemoving Duplicates Based on a Variable\n\nDAT |&gt;           \n  distinct(Id)     #  Remove duplicates by variable; passes unique values for data frame\n\n   Id\n1 100\n2 101\n3 102\n4 103\n5 104\n6 105\n\n\nBut this function simply returns the unique values in Id. To retain the variables, set .keep_all = T. If you want to remove duplicates and assign the cleaned data frame to an object, you would likely want to keep all of your variables.\n\nDAT |&gt;             \n  distinct(Id, \n           .keep_all = T\n           ) #\n\n   Id     Sex Age Renting\n1 100    male  25     yes\n2 101  female  33    &lt;NA&gt;\n3 102    Male  27     yes\n4 103    &lt;NA&gt;  40    &lt;NA&gt;\n5 104     man  44      no\n6 105 neither  40     yes\n\n\nNotice, however, this only removed the last instance or Id == 100. Which row to include is a judgment call. The first, the last, neither, the average? Is there a correct answer?"

I will assume that you attend class with some level of basic understanding of concepts and working of functions. The goal of reading should be to understand and implement code functions as well as support your understanding and help your troubleshooting of problems. This cannot happen if you just read the content without interacting with it, however reading is absolutely essential to being successful during class time.\nThis module contains information for importing and reading data that you might experience either in this class or beyond. Several concepts are covered along with examples in the event that you encounter some issue in the future, you know you can return to this module to help you. However, you many not deal with they special instances. For example, we will work primarily with .csv and .Rds files which will be provided to you. That being said, I obtained the data as a .sas7bdat SAS data file which I converted to .Rds for you. You may similarly find yourself at some point in the future needing libraries to open special files types, so I present some details here simply to make you aware that reading them can be easy if you are aware of the correct tools. In addition. We also will not typically access data from a URL or webpage for this course but I show you that’s possible too.\nWhat’s most relevant for reading:\n\nWhat tidy data are\nWide versus long data formats/structures\nUnderstanding what filename extensions are\nUnderstanding what a comma-separated values file is\nManaging file paths with {here} with R projects (we will use the each week)\nWriting compressed .Rds files with saveRDS()\nReading compressed .Rds files with readRDS()\nWriting .csv files with readr::write_csv()\nImporting files with RStudio for the less confident\n\nWhat you can overlook unless you are curious\nUnless you are curious, you don’t need to: understand how to read or write .tsv SPSS, Stata Files, or Excel files using special libraries like {haven}, {foreign}, {readxl}, {openxlsx}, {rio}, or others. You don’t need to know how to handle messages with importing files or how to quiet messages unless you start seeing messages you don’t want. You won’t really need to know how to change column variable types because we will generally save data as .Rds files in order to prevent such problems. You also won’t need to know the differences between read.table(), read.csv(), and readr::read_csv() though you might at some point experience these differences when collaborating with others to handle data using different libraries that we will use.\nClass: In class, some functions and concepts will be introduced and we will practice implementing code through exercises. Specifically, we will use readr::write_csv(), readr::read_csv(), saveRDS(), and readRDS()."

    "title": "Importing and Exporting Data Frames",
    "section": "Tidy Files",
    "text": "Tidy Files\nThere are many sources of data files and data files take many forms and are structured in different ways. They can be tidy or they can be messy. In general, tidiness refers to a data structure. Much of data science involves wrangling data sets to make them tidy. Whether a data set is tidy or messy depends on how the rows and columns are matched up with cases/observations.\nSo what’s is considered tidy?\n\nEach variable is represented as a column\nEach case/observation is represented as a row\nEach value is represented in a row/column cell\n\nIn other words, data that are tidy are generally structured as two-dimensional flat files of data neatly arranged in rows and columns specifically such that columns are variables and rows contain observations. Cell contain the value of an observation for a variable. Whether data are tidy or messy, data files created by software will be saved to disk and will be recognized by a filename extension. Before addressing more about file names and extensions, let’s first get the look and feel of different structures or arrangements of data.\nFor example:\nname age iq\nBill 28  130\nJane 35  145\nSal  55  125\nAlthough we work with importing data files rather than create them, if you wanted to create the data frame for R we can to so easily with different function. We will discuss standard data frames and data frames that are tibbles later, we can create data frames in base R using the data.frame() function. We would name a variable and then assign the observations/cases as elements of a vector using the combine function, c().\n\ndata.frame(\n  name = c(\"Bill\", \"Jane\", \"Sal\"),\n  age  = c(28, 35, 55), \n  iq   = c(130, 145, 125)\n)\n\n  name age  iq\n1 Bill  28 130\n2 Jane  35 145\n3  Sal  55 125\n\n\nSimilarly, using the tribble() function from the {tibble} library, we can also create a special type of data frame known as a tibble. For tibbles, the arrangement of data is similar to how the data would appear in a file – variables as columns and cases as rows.\n\ntibble::tribble(\n  ~name, ~age, ~iq,\n  \"Bill\", 28, 130,\n  \"Jane\", 35, 145,\n  \"Sal\", 55, 125\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  name    age    iq\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Bill     28   130\n2 Jane     35   145\n3 Sal      55   125\n\n\nNotice that tibbles don’t take vector objects created using c() with which you are familiar by now. Whether created as a standard data frame or a tibble, the structure is the same but this example represents only one structure. Data sets do not always take this structure, so let’s consider formats that are considered wide-format or long-format so that you understand the difference. Later on, we will explore converted data in one format to the other format.\n\nWide-Format Data Files\nThe organization of those variables and observations can change based on the person or system creating them or based on an analytics software’s expectations for working with those values. In many instances, columns of data sets represent variables and the rows represent the cases/observations. SPSS for example, works with data sets organized in wide-format.\nLet’s work through an example of a wide-format data file. Weight could be an interesting property to measure for tracking a weight-loss program or a body-building program. Weight could be measured weekly or monthly (repeated measures). Let’s say you have measured weight for three or more individuals on three different occasions. In wide-format, the cases correspond to rows and the variables as columns but each measurement is treated as a separate variable combination of weight and time.\n\ntibble::tribble(\n  ~name, ~weight_time1, ~weight_time2, ~weight_time3,\n  \"Bill\", 175, 172, 160,\n  \"Jane\", 135, 130, 131,\n  \"Sal\", 160, 158, 150\n  )\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 4\n  name  weight_time1 weight_time2 weight_time3\n  &lt;chr&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;        &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Bill           175          172          160\n2 Jane           135          130          131\n3 Sal            160          158          150\n\n\nWe see here that all of the variables are not represented by columns. The individuals name is a variable but weight and time are somewhat confounded. The time variable should be a column and the cell for a row/column should represent the weight. What if the same data had a different structure?\n\n\nLong-Format Data Files\nR and R libraries generally prefer with data sets organized in long-format. In long-format, the cases still correspond to rows and the variables as columns. The difference is that the repeated measurements of weight are organize as separate rows. Because weight is measure at different time, each measurement of weight is associated explicitly with a new column variable time.\n\ntibble::tribble(\n  ~name, ~time, ~weight, \n  \"Bill\", 1, 175,\n  \"Bill\", 2, 172, \n  \"Bill\", 3, 160,\n  \"Jane\", 1, 135, \n  \"Jane\", 2, 130, \n  \"Jane\", 3, 131,\n  \"Sal\", 1, 160, \n  \"Sal\", 2, 158, \n  \"Sal\", 3, 150\n  ) \n\n# A tibble: 9 × 3\n  name   time weight\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;  &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Bill      1    175\n2 Bill      2    172\n3 Bill      3    160\n4 Jane      1    135\n5 Jane      2    130\n6 Jane      3    131\n7 Sal       1    160\n8 Sal       2    158\n9 Sal       3    150\n\n\nNote that this format is tidy. Each row represents an observation. For example, the first row corresponds to “Bill” who weighed 175 lbs at time 1. Similarly, each row contains observations for each variable and each cell contains a row/column value.\n\n\nRearranging Data Files\nDepending on the source of data or the requirement by a client or piece of software, you may sometimes need to rearrange data. For example, you may need to change a wide-formatted file to a long-formatted file or vice versa. For such instances, we will use pivoting functions from {tidyr}."

    "title": "Importing and Exporting Data Frames",
    "section": "Filename Extensions: General",
    "text": "Filename Extensions: General\nA filename extension is the suffix of the filename following the dot/period. For example, .txt is used for text files, .csv for comma-separated values files, .jpg or .png for image files, and .xls or xlsx for MS Excel files among many file types. The extension is used to help understand how the file should be opened (or read) using a program that can understand that file format. To some extent, extensions are arbitrary; you can change the extension of myfile.xlsx to myfile.txt. Changing the extension does not, however, change the format. Thus, extensions are not arbitrary to the extent that you will need a program that reads the file appropriately. The program that tries to read your newly named myfile.txt will assume the file is in a text format because of its new extension and will fail to open the file correctly. Using MS Excel to read the file will open it just fine because Excel understand the saved format.\nSo why does any of this matter? You may have never thought too much about filenames and extensions before. In fact, your computer may not even be set up to display extensions for common file types. Because data scientists deal with files of all different types, knowing these extensions is necessary for reading and writing data files appropriately. If your computer does not show file extensions, I recommend you change your computer settings so that you can see them by following these links for Mac or Windows PC computers.\n\nFilename Extensions for Data Files\nData files are often associated with .csv, .tsv, and .xlsx file extensions. If you have worked with various statistics software, you may be familiar with other formats like .sav for SPSS data files, .dta for Stata data files, or .sas7bdat for SAS data files. Knowing the file format will prove exceptionally helpful when trying to read data files. In fact, libraries like {haven} and more extensively {foreign} are dedicated specifically to reading data files into R that have been saved by data analytics software packages such as SPSS, Stata, SAS, Minitab, etc.\n\nComma-Separated Files, .csv\nEven for tidy data arranged neatly in rows and columns, one must know the structure of the data file in order to read the file and make sense of its contents.\nExample 1:\nAssume the following data were saved as a file with a .txt extension. The extension is not very diagnostic of the data structure.\n134 66 2000\n128 60 1985\nDo the two rows of data in the above example represent a single column corresponding to social security numbers or do they represent three columns corresponding to variables like weight, height, and year of birth? Both could be true.\nExample 2a, as comma-separated:\nWhen column values of data are separated by a comma ',', the file type is referred to as comma-separated values:\n134, 66, 2000\n128, 60, 1985\nAssuming the commas separate the variables, R would read the file and assign variable names to the columns. In this example, R tells you that there are 3 variables, which it automatically names, V1, V2, and V3.\n\n\n   V1 V2   V3\n1 134 66 2000\n2 128 60 1985\n\n\nExample 2b, as comma-separated:\n134 66 2000,\n128 60 1985,\nReading the data and telling R that commas separate the variables, R would read the file as:\n\n\n           V1 V2\n1 134 66 2000 NA\n2 128 60 1985 NA\n\n\nR is telling you that there are 2 variables, which it automatically names, V1 and V2. The first variable contains the numbers and the second variable contains NA values (missing values). Two variables are specified because the comma splits the row into two pieces representing two variable columns.\nJust because there are commas in a data file, this does not require that you read the file that way. By reading the same data but now telling R that spaces separate the variables rather than commas, R would read the same file as:\n\n\n   V1 V2    V3\n1 134 66 2000,\n2 128 60 1985,\n\n\nR now tells you that there are 3 variables but the last variable contains the comma. A comma is likely not relevant and would need to be removed as part of data cleaning.\nExample 3, comma-separated with variable headers:\nSome data files can include variable names (also separated by columns) at the top of the file. These are helpful with reading in the columns. The next example show what the file might look like.\nname, age, iq\nBill, 28, 130\nJane, 35, 145\nSal, 55, 125\nWhen R reads the file, useful variable names are displayed.\n\n\n  name age  iq\n1 Bill  28 130\n2 Jane  35 145\n3  Sal  55 125"

How to get the file path? Use {here}. To show that the file extension is not strictly important, we can name the file \"example3.txt\" even though the file format is comma-separated based on passing a comma for the separator parameter, sep = \",\".\n\nwrite.table(x = DAT3,                                  # data frame object\n            file = here::here(\"data\", \"example3.txt\"), # project path + data + filename\n            sep = \",\"                                  # delimiter\n)\n\nWarning: If you specify name only of the file (e.g., file = \"example3.txt\"), the data frame will be written to a default location because no file path was provided along with the file name. So where is that default location? Well it depends and it’s complicated depending on whether you are writing code inside files that are .R or .Rmd. By default, .Rmd files will assume the directory from which the .Rmd file is saved and opened. An .Rmd file, however, if not a data file; it’s an R Markdown file for the default directory will likely be someplace other than /data.\nIf you are organized, you (a) save your .R and .Rmd files in a code directory (e.g., /r) or a report directory (e.g., /reports), (b) save your data files in a /data directory, and (c) are using an RStudio Project. The TLDR is that the default is a problem. The solution is to specify the file path using file = the full file path, which is easy to do using here::here(), so just make this a habit now and save yourself from future headaches.\n\n\nWriting with write.csv()\nLet’s do the same using write.csv(). Again, check the help documentation, help(write.csv).\nParameters/Arguments:\n\nx: we need an argument for the data frame object to be written\nfile: we need a character string argument naming a file or a connection open for writing (aka the filepath)\nsep: the default is \",\", so we don’t need to supply it\n\nThe data frame is DAT and the file is file name along with the file path Let’s just change the filename extension to \".csv\" so that we don’t overwrite the previous example.\n\nwrite.csv(x = DAT3,\n          file = here::here(\"data\", \"example3.csv\")\n)\n\nNote: If you open this file with an editor on your computer, you will see a new column is added to it by default. This column has no name and each row of the file will contain a number reflecting the row number. Adding row names is the default before for the function. To omit these row numbers when writing your data, add row.names = FALSE. This is a recommendation and I believe good practice if using write.csv().\nExample:\nwrite.csv(x = DAT3,\n          file = here::here(\"data\", \"example3.csv\"),\n          row.names = FALSE\n)\n\n\nWriting with readr::write_csv()\nDespite it’s name, the {readr} library can save data frames too. Interestingly, at least at the time of this writing, {readr} allows you to write files in excel format even though you cannot open them.\nParameters/Arguments:\n\nx: we need an argument for the data frame object to be written\nfile: we need a character string argument naming a file or a connection open for writing (aka the filepath)\nsep: the default is \",\", so we don’t need to supply it\n\nLet’s now save DAT2a.\n\nreadr::write_csv(x = DAT2a,\n                 file = here::here(\"data\", \"example2a_readr.csv\")\n                 )\n\nNote: Unlike write.csv(), readr::write_csv() does not append the row number to a column."

A solution is to compress the files. The base R function saveRDS() will be the go-to here. By default, saveRDS() compresses the file. Compression will matter for larger data files.\nAlso, when you manipulate data frames, you may change variable types, create new variables of a certain type, etc. Writing you data out as a .csv file will not preserve these characteristics.\nBecause we have not yet addressed how to create or modify variable columns in data frames, we won’t actually change the data type of the data frame. However, if we modified a data frame and wanted to preserve the data types of the columns, saveRDS() would take care so this for us.

    "text": "Reading .csv Files\nReading .csv files can be accomplished in a variety of ways, most typically using base R functions or those from {readr}.\n\nBase R:\n\nread.table(file = \"my_filename.csv\", sep = \",\") is a flexible function requiring setting the separator character argument for sep\nread.csv(file = \"my_filename.csv\") is the same as above except that sep = \",\" is * {readr}:\nreadr::read_csv(file = \"my_filename.csv\")\n\n\nNOTE: Another term for the separator is delimiter, so you may see this used in documentation.\n\nReading with read.table()\nParameters/Arguments:\n\nfile: we need a character string argument naming a file or a connection open for writing (aka the filepath)\nsep: we need an argument for the character used to separate column variables (e.g., \" \", \",\", \"|\", \"\\t\", etc.)\n\nBecause the columns are separated by a comma, set sep = \",\":\n\nread.table(file = here::here(\"data\", \"example3.txt\"),\n           sep = \",\"\n           )\n\n  name age  iq\n1 Bill  28 130\n2 Jane  35 145\n3  Sal  55 125\n\n\n\n\nReading with read.csv()\nThis function is the same as read.table() except the separator has already been set to a comma.\nParameters/Arguments:\n\nfile: we need a character string argument naming a file or a connection open for writing (aka the filepath)\nsep: already predefined by default\n\n\nread.csv(file = here::here(\"data\", \"example3.txt\"))\n\n  name age  iq\n1 Bill  28 130\n2 Jane  35 145\n3  Sal  55 125\n\n\n\n\nReading with readr::read_csv()\nParameters/Arguments:\n\nfile: we need a character string argument naming a file or a connection open for writing (aka the filepath)\n\nBecause the columns are separated by a comma, set sep = \",\":\n\nreadr::read_csv(file = here::here(\"data\", \"example2a_readr.csv\"))\n\nRows: 2 Columns: 3\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndbl (3): wt_lbs, ht_in, yob\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  wt_lbs ht_in   yob\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1    134    66  2000\n2    128    60  1985\n\n\n\nHandling Messages with Importing\nWhen reading with this function, there will be some messaging in the console. One is to examine the column specifications using spec() or specifically readr::spec(). We can .\nspec() has one parameter x, which stands for the data frame. Because the file read is a data frame, we can just wrap the function in spec().\n\nreadr::spec(readr::read_csv(file = here::here(\"data\", \"example2a_readr.csv\")))\n\nRows: 2 Columns: 3\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndbl (3): wt_lbs, ht_in, yob\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\ncols(\n  wt_lbs = col_double(),\n  ht_in = col_double(),\n  yob = col_double()\n)\n\n\nAlternatively, if you read in the data frame and assigned it to an object name, you could call the object name itself as seen here.\n\nexample2a_readr &lt;- readr::read_csv(file = here::here(\"data\", \"example2a_readr.csv\"))\n\nRows: 2 Columns: 3\n── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────\nDelimiter: \",\"\ndbl (3): wt_lbs, ht_in, yob\n\nℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.\nℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.\n\n\nCall the data frame:\n\nexample2a_readr\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  wt_lbs ht_in   yob\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1    134    66  2000\n2    128    60  1985\n\n\nExamine the column types of example2a_readr with spec():\n\nreadr::spec(example2a_readr)\n\ncols(\n  wt_lbs = col_double(),\n  ht_in = col_double(),\n  yob = col_double()\n)\n\n\nWe now see the column types are all numeric, doubles.\n\n\nChanging column variable types\nIf your column variables were not all numeric and you wanted to change them, you could specify the data types in the order the variables appear in the data set (e.g., from left to right). To do this, we need to pass an argument for col_types. Although all the columns are numbers, to illustrate, we will declare one a \"double\", one a \"factor\", and one a \"character\" that is not a factor.\ncol_types = list(\"double\", \"factor\", \"character\")\n\nexample2a_readr &lt;- readr::read_csv(file = here::here(\"data\", \"example2a_readr.csv\"),\n                                   col_types = list(\"double\", \"factor\", \"character\")\n                                   )\n\nCall the data frame:\n\nexample2a_readr\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  wt_lbs ht_in yob  \n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;fct&gt; &lt;chr&gt;\n1    134 66    2000 \n2    128 60    1985 \n\n\nThe tibble now lists the three different data types below the variable names. Remember, you cannot perform math on factors and character variables. Just to solidify just how the variables changed when read in, we can examine each variable to see what the vectors look like.\nThe \"double\" variable reveals numeric values:\n\nexample2a_readr$wt_lbs\n\n[1] 134 128\n\n\nThe \"factor\" variable reveals levels:\n\nexample2a_readr$ht_in\n\n[1] 66 60\nLevels: 66 60\n\n\nThe \"character\" variable reveals the years as strings:\n\nexample2a_readr$yob\n\n[1] \"2000\" \"1985\"\n\n\n\n\nQuieting the message\nThe other part of the message suggested quieting the message, which we can do when reading by setting show_col_types = FALSE:\n\nexample2a_readr &lt;- readr::read_csv(file = here::here(\"data\", \"example2a_readr.csv\"),\n                                   show_col_types = FALSE\n                                   )\n\nCall the data frame object:\n\nexample2a_readr\n\n# A tibble: 2 × 3\n  wt_lbs ht_in   yob\n   &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1    134    66  2000\n2    128    60  1985"

If datatypes for variables change, you would need to track those changes so that you can return the data frame to its last state. An alternative is saveRDS() saves datatypes, file encoding, and also compresses the file. Thus, saveRDS() and readRDS() will be go to functions.\nParameters/Arguments:\n\nfile: we need a character string argument naming a file or a connection open for writing (aka the filepath)\n\n\nreadRDS(file = here::here(\"data\", \"example3.rds\"))\n\n# A tibble: 3 × 3\n  name    age    iq\n  &lt;chr&gt; &lt;dbl&gt; &lt;dbl&gt;\n1 Bill     28   130\n2 Jane     35   145\n3 Sal      55   125\n\n\n\nTab-Separated Files, .tsv\nWhen column values of data are separated by a TAB, the file type is referred to as tab-separated values:\nColumns of data are separated by a tab \"\\t\":\nname    age   iq\nBill    28    130\nJane    35    145\nSal   55    125\nLet’s say these files are all simple text files and unlike the previous .csv example are not saved with extension .tsv that would flag the file format. To provide more detail about opening data files, instead assume that the file is saved as a .txt file. Technically speaking, a csv file is also just a raw text file for which the text is separated by commas. In some instances, you will encounter csv files with extensions like .txt, .dat, .raw, etc.\n\nBase R:\n\nread.table(file = \"my_filename.txt\", sep = \"\\t\") is a flexible function requiring setting the separator character argument for sep\nread.tsv(file = \"my_filename.txt\") is the same as above except that sep = \"\\t\" is the default\n\n{readr}:\n\nreadr::read_tsv(file = \"my_filename.txt\")\n\n\nWe likely won’t be dealing with .tsv files, so we won’t work through an example here.\n\n\nReading Excel Data Files, .xlsx\nFirst, we need an .xlsx data file.

In order to create a character object, we would need to place the characters within quotation marks (e.g., single or double, does not matter). The quotes let R know the contents of container are characters (aka strings).\n\"things\"\nWhen dealing with data, you will encounter many character objects as they often represent factor variables (e.g., race, ethnicity, favorite game, etc.) but you will also see lots of objects that are numeric in some form (e.g., age, rating, cognitive performance, etc.).\nSilly Example:\n\n\"something\" assigned to container\ncontainer &lt;- \"something\"\n\n\ncontainer &lt;- \"things\"\n\nAnd to see its contents, use print() to return the objects content:\n\nprint(container)\n\n[1] \"things\"\n\n\nOr just type the name of the object and you will see the returned object is \"things\".\n\ncontainer\n\n[1] \"things\"\n\n\nFor another example, we could also create an object called name, which we could assign a set of characters, like Jim Bob, making the object a character object.\n\nname &lt;- \"Jim Bob\"\n\nTo see what is returned:\n\nname\n\n[1] \"Jim Bob\"\n\n\nWhether you name is or is not Jim Bob, you can see that name contains the characters that represent the name of someone named “Jim Bob”. Although we assigned \"Jim Bob\" to name, we could have assigned it a given name. The assignment process simply stores the assigned information as an object using of whatever name you decided to call it (e.g., name, Name, NAME, xyz, etc.). We will discuss more on these letter casing differences later.\nYou could also assign the character to the object this way.\n\n\"things\" -&gt; container\n\nHowever, we won’t use much of this approach for different reasons. One reason is that doing so does not follow the R Style Guide. The style guide defines a set of guidelines for coding in R. Rather than memorize all of the styling, pay careful attention to the way code appears in the examples provided and try your best to model your code after the examples. For example, don’t do something this container&lt;-\"things\" just so you save space as doing so makes the code more difficult for you and others to read and understand.\nOK, back to Jim Bob. Of course, there are different people other than Jim Bob who exist in the world but when coding, they do not exist unless you create them. So, let’s create an object that holds the name of \"Jim Bob\".\nname &lt;- \"Jim Bob\"\n\nname &lt;- \"Jim Bob\"     # assign string to object named name\n\n\nName &lt;- \"Jim Bob\"     # we could have assigned it a different name, say Name\n\n\nNAME &lt;- \"Jim Bob\"     # or assigned it in all caps\n\nWhenever you reference the object name (or Name), R will return the contents of the object to you, which in this case will be a character or string object containing a single person’s name because that’s how we assigned it.\n\nname               # call object to return contents of \"name\"\n\n[1] \"Jim Bob\"\n\n\nAnd again, we can use print() to do the same thing:\n\nprint(name)\n\n[1] \"Jim Bob\"\n\n\n\nBeing mindful of case sensitivity\nA word of warning is needed here. Although name, Name, and NAME all contain the same four characters, n a m and e all arranged it he same order, the objects are all different. They just happen to hold the same content. The reason for there being three different object is because R is a case-sensitive language, which means that the letter case matters. In some programming languages, the case is ignored.\nTo illustrate, consider an example for which you assign different names to the object.\nname &lt;- \"Jim Bob\"     # create the object\n\n\nName &lt;- \"Bob\"         # then change it\n\n\nNAME &lt;- \"Jim\"         # then change it again\nIn those languages, if you asked what the name object contained, the program would return \"Jim\" because these characters were assigned last, even though they were assigned to an uppercase version, NAME. With R, you will need to be mindful of the letter case. This is by design, perhaps an advantage rather than a disadvantage."

There is something else important about how R treats them that you cannot see on the surface. Both of these objects are also vectors. Vectors are one-dimensional arrays containing n pieces of information. You might also think of a vector so a variable (e.g., IQs of people). Both the name and year vectors contain only one piece of information, however. If you don’t believe me, we can use some functions that will answer this for us.\n\nis.vector() is a function that returns a logical (T or F) about whether the object is a vector\nlength() is a function that returns a non-negative numeric integer representing the number of elements contained\ntypeof() is a function that returns the object’s type\n\nLet’s try them by passing the object name inside the function.\n\nis.vector(name)   # is it a vector?\n\n[1] TRUE\n\n#?length\nlength(name)      # how many elements?\n\n[1] 1\n\ntypeof(name)      # what is it's type?\n\n[1] \"character\"\n\n\nIf name contained more than one object, it would still be a vector having a different length. But in order to create such vectors, each element of the vector needs to be separated by a comma and each elements needs to be wrapped by quotes.\nIf you do not separate strings by a comma…\n\nname &lt;- \"Jim Bob Kendra\"\n\n\nname                                # return object; also print(name)\n\n[1] \"Jim Bob Kendra\"\n\nis.character(name)                  # is it a character?\n\n[1] TRUE\n\nlength(name)                        # what is its length?\n\n[1] 1\n\n\nIf you do use quotes for each element and separate each by a comma, you need to use a function to combine them, which is c().\n\nname &lt;- c(\"Jim Bob\", \"Kendra\")  # two names, combine with c()\n\n\n\nis.character(name)        \n\n[1] TRUE\n\nlength(name)                   # vector with length 2\n\n[1] 2\n\n\nThe more you work with character vector, the more you way want to avoid some annoyances of creating them.\nThe {Hmisc} library has a function called Cs() that obviates the inclusion of the quotes.\n\nHmisc::Cs(Jim, Kendra, Bill, Sandy)\n\n[1] \"Jim\"    \"Kendra\" \"Bill\"   \"Sandy\" \n\n\nBeware of vectors containing elements with space like this:\nHmisc::Cs(Jim Bob, Kendra)\nR will throw an error to inform you that something is wrong. For example: Error: unexpected symbol in \"Hmisc::Cs(Jim Bob\"."

Git long with GitHub will allow you to track your edits (the version control) and share your code with your collaborators or interested scholars.\nSome benefits of using version control:\n\nFacilitates project sharing (once it’s setup, you’ll get there)\nFacilitates collaboration. Others can also report errors or suggest features to your project.\nMakes reverting back to previous states easy.

    "text": "Configuring Git and GitHub\nThere are two ways you can set up, either using R (console) or the command line (terminal). My recommendation is to use R because that is where you are likely most familiar, if even a small degree. We will use functions from the {usethis} library to help you. This library should be installed already as part of the class setup. If you get an error stating that the library is not installed when executing the steps below, just type install.packages(\"usethis\", dep = TRUE) at your R console.\nThe {usethis} library will make connecting your R project to your github account simple. You will use usethis::use_git_config() to configure your GitHub account with Git on your computer; if you did not create, see earlier step. In the below example, you will see that we need to provide two character strings as arguments to the function. The strings are used to set your user.name and your user.email (the e-mail attached to your GitHub account). Double check your GitHub e-mail and username.\nEdit the following code to include your username and email and then execute your modified R code:\nusethis::use_git_config(user.name = \"github_username\", \n                        user.email = \"github_email@gitrdone.com\"\n                        )\nDone!"

    "text": "Creating a Personal Access Token (PAT) for GitHub\nBefore completing this step, log into your GitHub account to facilitate the communication between RStudio and GitHub.\nYou will need a personal access token (PAT) for making remote changes to GitHub. A first step then is to create a PAT using usethis::create_github_token(). Second, you will register your PAT with the Git credential manager used by your computers operating system using gitcreds::gitcreds_set(). Keep in mind that if you use a different computer (e.g., you get a new one), you’ll need to register the PAT on that computer following the same steps described here.\nTo create your personal access token (PAT), type the following at your R console: \nusethis::create_github_token()\nAfter executing the code, you will be taken to your GitHub account (if you remained logged in). Go to the bottom of the page and click generate token. You should add a description for it so that you can understand its use case. For example, describe it based the computer you are using it on, “my computer make and model”. You may also describe it based on a project you are working on, “token-for-project-xyz”. If you do not add a description, you will likely become overwhelmed and/or confused when you have multiple tokens. When you need to regenerate or delete a token that expires, you will not be able to determine what they are for if you do not add a description.\nAfter creating your token, Copy it to your computer’s clipboard and save it someplace safe. Do not share your token with anyone because anyone who has it can access your public or private GitHub repositories.\nWarning: Your PAT will expire after some duration, usually 30 days unless you change it. For this project, I suggest you change the expiration to a date after the semester ends to ensure you don’t have to go through this process again during the semester. Getting a new PAT is not difficult, however. If your PAT will soon expire, GitHub will send you an e-mail alerting you also. You can regenerate a PAT from a link in your e-mail, so make sure your associated e-mail is one you check."

If you see them, enter the number corresponding to the option that makes the most sense for what you are trying to accomplish, for example, something like “set or replace your credentials”.\nWhen should then see a prompt like ?

Visual representations provide accessible ways to see patterns, trends, and outliers in data. Variables like position, size, and orientation can focus attention and guide perception but can also bias interpretation of data. Students will learn how well-designed visualizations can reduce bias and improve comprehension for data thereby facilitating data-driven decision-making. Students will explore techniques for creating effective visualizations based on principles from cognitive and perceptual psychology, art, and design. Students will gain hands-on experience coding real-world data visualizations for local offices, organizations, and industry participants.\nThe course is targeted toward students with expressed interest in cognition and cognitive biases related to data communication, students interested in using visualization to communicate their own messages, and students interested in creating better visualization tools and systems. Students will engage in discussions of the readings, complete programming and data analysis assignments, and prepare a final project involving storytelling with data visualizations."

These special character combinations simply allow RStudio to know what is R code (e.g., the lowercase r) and what is written text.\nIn RStudio, you can modify the code block/chunk by clicking the gear to make changes. You can specify whether the code shows the output only, shows the code and the output, whether the code is executed but not shown, or whether the code is not run at all. You can also toggle one and off options to display warnings, message, and other details. You can also review other options if you wish. You’ll notice that warnings and messages will make your output ugly so hiding them is often ideal.\nThis exercise serves as a tutorial with the goal of familiarizing you with using R and R Markdown.

    "text": "Making Local File Changes, Committing, and Pushing to GitHub\n\nMaking a local change\n\nCreate a .R script and name it something like yourname.R. Where should you save it? You guessed it: /r.\n\nChecking the status of local file changes\n\nCheck for the local changes you have made at the Terminal by typing git status and press return/enter\n\n$ git status\n\nIf you made changes, Git will tell you what those changes are. For example, there will be a new file, a deleted file, a modified file, etc.\n\nStaging Changes (Add Changes)\n\nStage a specific change: If you made multiple changes and all you want to do is commit a single change and no others, you can specify the change you want to add. For example, if you want only to add a specific file, like yourname.R, you will use git add &lt;file&gt;... such that &lt;file&gt; refers to the file name.\n\nAt the Terminal prompt, type git add followed by &lt;file&gt; to include in what will be committed)\n$ git add r/yourname.R\n\nStage all change(s): When you make numerous changes, you may wish not to specify each file individually as that could be tedious. In this case, you may wish to stage all of your changes. Assuming everything you are doing is relevant to the project, one of the easiest ways to add changes is to just add all of your file changes. Note, your changes should not be done inside data files (e.g., .csv, .xlsx). Changes should only be done using R code. If not, your project will not be reproducible.\n\nAt the Terminal, you can type git add . which tells Git that you are adding all of those changes to commit them.\n$ git add .\n\n\nCommitting the change(s)\n\nNow that you made a change, you will commit it and assign a useful message to remind your future self and collaborators what you just did.\n\nAt the Terminal, type git commit to commit the changes, add -m to tell git you want a message, and then type the message as a string, \"my message here\" and then press enter/return to commit the changes.\n$ git commit -m \"added my first .R file\"\n\n\nPush the change to the remote repository\n\nWe need to push the changes to the remote GitHub repository for version control and for collaborators to access\n\nAt the Terminal, you will push those changes using git push and press enter/return to push.\n$ git push\n\nIf you navigate to your GitHub account in your web browser, you will see the changes there as soon as they arrive. Congrats!\n\nPractice (Yes, seriously): Changing, Committing, and Pushing Again\n\nYou know that file with your name is not needed for the project. Delete it from the project as you normally would delete a file (no need to use the Terminal) and then add the change, commit the change with message “deleted my silly file”, and push changes.\nIf for some reason, your push did not work, you may need to specify the project branch. Branching is beyond the scope of this course. If team members are working on separate tasks, their code will be compartmentalized so you can use the main branch.\n\nYou can set the branch to the main branch at the Terminal using git branch -M main.\n$ git branch -M main\n\n\nPushing Specific File Changes\n\nYou should not push all of your edits. For example, if you edit a file and save it but it is incomplete (e.g., it contains errors) that will create problems for your team members, you do not want to push them to the repo. If you do, your team member’s code will also break if they are sourcing (e.g., source()) your script file. Similarly, if the data file you write out contains errors, a teammate cannot read that file in successfully. So make sure that what you push is correct and accurate before pushing.\n\nPulling Changes from the Remote\n\nThe opposite of push is pull. When your teammates push their changes (e.g., data cleaning, file creation, etc.) to the repo and your code depends on those files, you will want to make sure their edits are in your local project so that you can use them.\n\nTo pull the changes down to your project, at the Terminal, type git pull.\n$ git pull\n\nYou should find the changes appear in your local project directory."

In those cases, use .R code script files. Use .Rmd files only for a report containing text and minor code.

    "section": "Recoding vectors",
    "text": "Recoding vectors\nSometimes elements of vectors are messy and need to be fixed. In general, this process is referred to as recoding. There are various ways to recode in R and there are special libraries dedicated to recoding. Now, we will perform some simple recoding.\nYou can use ifelse() or dplyr::case_when() to test whether the elements of a vector match some condition and if yes (do one thing), otherwise no (do something else). In order to understand how these functions and many others work we need to understand a logical test.\n\nifelse()\ndplyr::case_when()\n\n\nPerforming a logical test\nWe can perform a logical test on all types of objects but this example will focus on vectors, for which all elements will be examined. The logical test will return TRUE or FALSE for each vector element depending on whether the case matches a test condition.\nRather than illustrate this the 1000 element sex vector, we will create a vector of length 5 called temp_sex. In this example, you will also see what happens when you need to clean up and recode the sloppy data. You can see are composed of both upper and lower case letters presumably corresponding to biological sex. Because R is a case-sensitive language, \"M\" and \"m\" represent different objects even though the intent is for them to be the same.\n\ntemp_sex &lt;- c(\"M\", \"m\", \"F\", \"f\", NA)\n\nYou can see that some character elements in the vector are upper- and lowercase m’s and f’s. Let’s see what happens when we perform a logical test of the vector. Remember that by itself = will be assignment (like &lt;-). In order to determine whether an object or elements of an object is equal to something, we use ==.\nFor example, temp_sex == \"M\":\n\ntemp_sex == \"M\"\n\n[1]  TRUE FALSE FALSE FALSE    NA\n\n\nThe returned vector is of the same length as the vector tested. Each element of the vector was tested and those elements that matched the character \"M\" returns TRUE. The other elements are FALSE, except of the NA, or missing value. Importantly, the logical test does not return FALSE for NAs.\n\n\nRecoding using ifelse()\nLet’s perform the logical test inside ifelse(). The function will test each element and IF it is TRUE (matches the condition) will assign 0, else/otherwise assign 1 in order to recode the letters into numbers. Of course, you may often wish to recode letters into other letters.\n\nifelse(temp_sex == \"M\", 0, 1)\n\n[1]  0  1  1  1 NA\n\n\nWe can see that all of the TRUEs are 0 and all else except for NA are 0. You can see that only the \"M\" was recoded to 0 and all other elements that were not NA were recoded as 1. Clearly, this is not correct. We can use multiple ifelse() functions but the solution won’t be offered here because it’s just really messy. Instead of focusing on bad code, let’s just focus on offering better solutions.\nPerforming the same test on sex but piping the vector to head() will allow for inspection of the first few elements.\n\nifelse(sex == \"M\", 0, 1) |&gt;\n  head()\n\n[1] 1 1 1 1 1 1\n\n\nThe ifelse() approach is fine for two groups. When there are more than two groups, however, re-coding can be confusing with ifelse() because you’ll need to nest an ifelse() inside an ifelse(). The popular {dplyr} library also has a couple functions similar to ifelse(), for example, if_else() and case_when().\n\n\nRecoding using dplyr::case_when()\nThe case_when() function will also perform logical tests but you can easily specify more than one. The help documentation tells us that “This function allows you to vectorise multiple if_else() statements. Each case is evaluated sequentially and the first match for each element determines the corresponding value in the output vector. If no cases match, the .default is used as a final”else” statement.” And later “If none of the cases match and no .default is supplied, NA is used.\nWith case_when(), we will perform a logical test of the elements against the character string \"M\" first. The elements that match \"M\" will evaluate as TRUE and will be recoded as 0. Then the elements of the new recoded vector will be tested again against \"F\". Those that are TRUE will be recoded as 1. Anything else will be assigned NA for missing because they matched neither \"M\" nor \"F\".\nWe wee that only the first element returns TRUE. Other elements are FALSE or NA.\n\ndplyr::case_when(\n  temp_sex == \"M\" ~ 0,\n  temp_sex == \"F\" ~ 1\n  ) \n\n[1]  0 NA  1 NA NA\n\n\nBut note that if the character case is inconsistent, NA’s will replace elements that are \"m\" and \"f\". An easy fix for casing is to convert the vector (without assignment) by passing it to tolower() or toupper() and then perform the logical conversion on the case change elements.\n\ndplyr::case_when(\n  toupper(temp_sex) == \"M\" ~ 0,\n  toupper(temp_sex) == \"F\" ~ 1\n  ) \n\n[1]  0  0  1  1 NA\n\n\nYou can now see that all elements will evaluate to TRUE and are recoded except for the NA in the vector. Keep in mind that strings may be very messy and require careful inspection and cleaning. Sometimes simple case recoding solves your problems.\nNote: There is a much powerful library called {stringr} for wrangling strings. We will use this library to perform other tasks. If you wanted to familiarize yourself with making strings upper or lowercase using that library, use stringr::str_to_lower() and stringr::str_to_upper().\nTo illustrate:\n\nlibrary(stringr)            # load the library first\n\ndplyr::case_when(\n  str_to_upper(temp_sex) == \"M\" ~ 0,\n  str_to_upper(temp_sex) == \"F\" ~ 1\n  ) \n\n[1]  0  0  1  1 NA\n\n\nWhen you have more logical tests to perform, you can specify them on a new line. Using the existing vector, we can illustrate with a silly example.\n\ndplyr::case_when(\n  temp_sex == \"m\" ~ \"Young Men\",\n  temp_sex == \"M\" ~ \"Old Men\",\n  temp_sex == \"f\" ~ \"Young Women\",\n  temp_sex == \"F\" ~ \"Old Women\",\n  ) \n\n[1] \"Old Men\"     \"Young Men\"   \"Old Women\"   \"Young Women\" NA           \n\n\nWe have not recoded the vector to have clear names for 4 groups, plus and NAs. Of course, you have not changed temp_sex unless you assign the returned vector to a name.\n\ntemp_sex\n\n[1] \"M\" \"m\" \"F\" \"f\" NA \n\n\nAssign to temp_sex to overwrite:\n\ntemp_sex &lt;- dplyr::case_when(\n  temp_sex == \"m\" ~ \"Young Men\",\n  temp_sex == \"M\" ~ \"Old Men\",\n  temp_sex == \"f\" ~ \"Young Women\",\n  temp_sex == \"F\" ~ \"Old Women\",\n  ) \n\n\ntemp_sex\n\n[1] \"Old Men\"     \"Young Men\"   \"Old Women\"   \"Young Women\" NA"

You goal for the midterm presentation will be to present and discuss data visualizations, or variants thereof, that could find their way into the end-of-semester final presentation and report deliverable.\nYou will be evaluated on you and your team’s ability to convey the steps taken to clean up the data in service of creating some plots as well as share a decision-making journey of plot creation. Any variables that needed to be fixed or modified, factorized, computed anew, or summarized in some way can resulted in one single starting data frame/tibble and likely some smaller data summaries. Teams taking different approaches, or who are guided by liaisons who have different interests, will end up with different data, different data visualizations, and different stories. Include code where appropriate to communicate how you achieved your goals.\nAt this stage in the project, the important point is that all team members should be working with data, challenge themselves to think about data, and practice using {ggplot} for creating data visualizations. Thus, all team members must have two plots, even if those plots communicate detailed variants of the same performance metric. By plot variants, mean Same Data, Different Stories. Variant plots use the same data but are visualized differently in order to facilitate different comparisons, use additional date to provide a more nuanced or detailed interpretation, use different levels/grouping of exiting variables, or use a different scaling structures, etc. Alternatively, the two plots could visualize different metrics obtained from the data, different calculations of a metric, compare different calculations, etc. to represent depths to data inquiry.\nAn example of looking at the data in different ways is illustrated in Nathan Yau’s post One Dataset, Visualized 25 Ways. If you struggle to think about data, you can also check out his post on how to think like a statistician without the math. I believe that the most valuable comment is this post to in the Ask Why section. He explains that “…the most important thing I’ve learned, [is to] always ask why. When you see a blip in a graph, you should wonder why it’s there. If you find some correlation, you should think about whether or not it makes any sense. If it does make sense, then cool, but if not, dig deeper. Numbers are great, but you have to remember that when humans are involved, errors are always a possibility.” Asking why data are they way they are is important because patterns in data can happen by chance or for some systematic reason. Any systematic influence has to have a reason, an explanation for its presence. Although you may be able to describe a pattern or influence, if you cannot provide an explanation for it, there is no useful way to make that information actionable."

Use words. In your final report, you will be telling a story about the data. You will not just present plots and talk about them. For example, you make introduce a research question that the plot will either help answer or provide information about examining further. After walking the reader through the problem, you will reference a figure containing the plot. For the midterm presentation, you will similarly introduce a question that the plot will help address. Mention the data that the plot visualizes. Are these data minimums, maximums, means, medians, measures of variability, etc. Do the data represent groups of people? Do they include dates? Think of this step as a topic slide before presenting the plot. Your topic title should be brief and clear and you should fill in any more detail with words. This step will set the stage for the audience to understand what data you would be presenting before you throw a plot in their face.\n\n\nPlot Reveal and Explanation\nYou should make sure that you walk the reader through the data visualization. Be explicit about what the axes represent and what any aesthetics represent so that the audience does not have to figure this out. In other words, do not just present the plot and say “we can see there are differences in metric X across time”. Instead, say something more clear like: “This plot visualizes data about Event X for Group/Person/year Y. Along the horizontal axis is… a long the y axis is…. You can see that the average range of times/distances for Event X decreases as athletes’ move through class ranks (e.g, FR to SR). This pattern in the data suggests that…”. You get the point.\n\n\nPlot Discussion\nFor each plot you should:\n\nexplain why you selected this plot as the data visualization of choice to communicate the element of data being communicated\nincorporate information from readings about why you have chosen this plot type\nexplain what modifications you made to the plot (feel free to share code)\nexplain limitations that the plot contains\nshare your future goals to:\n\nreplace the plot with a completely new plot for reason X\nmodify it in one or various ways to solve limitation X, Y, and X\nleave plot as is/explain why the plot needs no work"

    "text": "The final written report for the project will be delivered to me and to your liaison. I can provide a color-printed copy for you to distribute to the liaison and for their offices. The final report is to be created in R Markdown and knit as a Pdf or Word document. An example starter file can be found here. You are not to write the document in GoogleDocs, or other sharing platforms. The course is designed for you to acquire new skills and build confidence in those skills rather than support other skills. Investing in yourself is what will get you internships, jobs, and leadership roles in labs and lab manager roles in graduate school. Thus, the report is to be put in R Markdown and maintained in the remote repository. Because RStudio does not have grammar check capability, you are free to create your own personal content in a Word Processing software like MS Word before you add the content to R Markdown. However, I advise you change the font in that working file to sans serif font because R Markdown may get confused with certain characters (e.g., serif font apostrophes, etc.) and you may need to fix these issues later. After running your grammar and spelling check, then add the content to the .Rmd file. If you do work in a separate file, you will need to make sure to save this file to the project /report directory and ensure you push that file to the remote repository. Also, make sure you use your initials in the file name so that team members don’t all have the same file names.\nA code lead should take on the responsibility to save the file to /report the team project, add, commit, and push the file to the remote repo on GitHub. When the team works on this report file shared with others on GitHub, I recommend two different approaches:\n\nThe team agrees to request adding changes to the document on a case-by-case basis. The PM oversees the process and controls delegation. A member requests permission from the PM to edit the file through the team Discord channel. The PM approves the request and broadcasts to the team on Discord that Member A will issue a pull request to update the local file with the remote file. After pulling the changes, Member A will (1) update the file locally by adding their content, (2) save the file on their local system, (3) knit an HTML version to ensure there are no errors in knitting and so that others can review your edits without actually opening the .Rmd file, (4) and then exit the file so that it is not active in RStudio. Then, they will (5) add, commit (with a description), and push the changed file to the remote repo on GitHub. Once complete, Member A broadcasts to the team on Discord that they have pushed their changes. The PM asks to verify (just to double check) that Member A has actually exited the file. Once verified, the PM broadcasts that other team members can request from the PM permission to edit the file. Do not edit without permission from the PM.\nThe team agrees upon a contribution schedule (dates, hours) and the PM creates and controls delegation of who will be working on which section and at what time. The PM broadcasts to the team on Discord that Member A will issue a pull request to update the local file with remote file. After pulling the changes, Member A will (1) update the file locally by adding their content, (2) save the file on their local system, (3) knit an HTML version to ensure there are no errors in knitting and so that others can review your edits without actually opening the .Rmd file, (4) and then exit the file so that it is not active in RStudio. Then, they will (5) add, commit (with a description), and push the changed file to the remote repo on GitHub. Once complete, Member A broadcasts to the team on Discord that they have pushed their changes. The PM asks to verify (just to double check) that Member A has closed the file. Then the PM broadcasts that the file can be edited by the next team member according to the schedule agreed upon. Do not edit without permission from the PM.\nThe team decides to work in separate files and create copies of the main .Rmd document that include team member’s initials as a suffix to the filename. The team delegates the sections to be written by specific team members. Each member edits their file, saves it, and ensures they can knit an HTML version of the file. If successful without error, then, they and add, commit, and push changes to the remote so. Team members can view the HTML version without actually opening your file. Although this approach may appear easiest, it presents other problems which is a reason why I recommend it as a third option. A major limitation of this approach is with integrating work. Arranging, rearranging, revising work is more difficult when you are dealing with multiple files. Weaving pieces into one another can be difficult. Team members who need to integrate sections will need to identify where content will be inserted (e.g., between what sentences, etc.). This is a common problem with working with separate files whether by yourself or with others. Also, pieces that are in one file may be overlooked and not incorporated. Problems mentioned here as well as others does not make this approach the most convenient in the long long. Moreover, this approach does not involve as much communication between team members, which all of you know is always essential to successful teamwork. Options #1 and #2 ensure this communication.\n\nNote: Remember that with a version control system like Git, you always have access to all versions of the files pushed to GitHub. You can always revert to a prior version. I can help you with this if you get to this point. Good messages in your commits will be helpful here."
