For this course, we use the R programming language. Although you may have a preferred IDE, my recommendation is to use RStudio. All instructions will assume you are using RStudio. We will also use the R Markdown language for report documents. Projects will be managed at GitHub and will interface with RStudio using the Git program. 

## Setup Structure

- Install R and RStudio
- Create a GitHub account if you do not have one
- Install Git if your computer system needs it (e.g., not installed) 

## Other Setup Topics

For those requiring refreshers about R Markdown, functions, and scripts are in this section.
